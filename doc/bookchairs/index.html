<h2>ACLPUB HOWTO: Putting Together an ACL Proceedings Volume</h2>

<h3>Who Should Read This Document</h3>

<p>This guide to the <code>aclpub</code> software will help you create
a single proceedings volume for an ACL-affiliated conference.
Presumably, you are one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the program chair of a workshop
  <li>the program chair of the short paper, poster, and/or demo session
  <li>the publications chair of the overall conference (who
  traditionally assembles the main proceedings)
</ul>

<p>In short, you are a "book chair."  This document will assume that
you are specifically the program chair of a workshop, since most
workshops act like this.</p>

<p><font size=-1><i>Note:</i> For our purposes, the student research workshop and
the short paper session are considered to be separate logical books,
even though they may be physically bound together (along with tutorial
program info) into a single "companion volume."</font></p>

<p><font size=-1><i>Note:</i>There is an additional HOWTO aimed at the
publications chair of the overall conference.</font></p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>We have tried to automate the process as much as possible.
However, it still requires manual input.  You should allocate 2-3
hours for this process.  <b>The final look of your proceedings is your
responsibility!</b></p>

<p>By following these instructions, you will produce the
following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>a single <code>book.pdf</code> file that contains your entire
  proceedings volume.  The volume will then be professionally printed
  and also distributed as a PDF file on the conference CD-ROM.  It is
  meant to look good both when printed and when browsed onscreen during
  the conference.</p>

  <p>In brief, the scripts use the LaTeX <code>pdfpages</code> package
  to combine all the papers plus front matter into a single PDF file.
  Page numbers and citation/copyright information are automatically
  "stamped" onto the included papers.  Papers with incorrect margins are
  shifted vertically at your discretion.  The workshop program, the
  table of contents, and the author index are produced almost
  automatically and contain clickable hyperlinks for the reader's
  convenience.</p>

  <li><p>a <code>spine.ps</code> file for the binding of the printed
  volume.

  <li><p>a <code>cdrom</code> directory that will be included on the
  conference CD-ROM.  This contains HTML web pages, modfied PDF and
  PostScript versions of the individual papers, and BibTeX
  bibliography entries.</p>

  <li><p>a <code>copyright-signatures</code> file with electronic
  signatures from the authors.  This will be sent to the ACL main
  office.</p>

  <li><p>an <code>advertisement.html</code> webpage that you, or 
  the conference webmaster, can use to advertise your program in
  advance.</p>

  <li><p>a few auxiliary data files that will be used again by the
  publications chair to produce other material for the CD-ROM (e.g.,
  a consolidated <a
  href="http://www.essex.ac.uk/linguistics/research/clgroup/aclbib/">BibTeX
  database</a> and a consolidated author index)
  and the online <a href="http://www.aclweb.org/anthology">ACL
  Anthology</a>.</p>
  
</ul>

<p>Here is a gratuitous flowchart to illustrate the process.  You will
be using a makefile that knows all about this flowchart and will
rebuild files whenever necessary.</p>

<h3>Who's Responsible</h3>

<ul>
  <li><p><b>If you have trouble figuring out how to use the
scripts,</b> ask the publications chair for help.</p>

  <li><p><b>If you think there is something wrong with the scripts, or have
  constructive comments,</b> email <img src="address.jpg" alt="(image of
  email address)" align="middle"> and cc the publications chair.</p>
  
  <li><p><b>If you want to improve the scripts or documentation</b>, you can
  check changes into the CVS repository.  (Contact Jason Eisner at the
  above address for CVS write access.)</p>
</ul>
  
<p><i>Acknowledgments:</i> The aclpub package and documentation were
built in 2005 by Jason Eisner and Philipp Koehn, based in part on
scripts by David Yarowsky that had been used for several years
previously.</p>

<h3>Get Software</h3>

<p>You'll want to use a Unix or Cygwin machine that offers all the
"usual" Unix commands, including CVS, GNU make, and a not-too-old <A
HREF="http://www.tug.org/teTeX">TeX distribution</A> that includes the
<A
HREF="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/pdfpages/">pdfpages
package</A>.</p>

<p>First go to your home directory and grab the latest version of the
software.  This will create a directory <code>~/aclpub</code>:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@ftp.clsp.jhu.edu:/aclpub checkout aclpub
</pre></blockquote>

<font size=-1><p>If you'd rather put the software somewhere else, go
ahead.  Just set the <code>ACLPUB</code> environment variable to the
directory where you put it:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
export ACLPUB=~/editing/myworkshop/aclpub   <i># in sh or bash</i>
setenv ACLPUB ~/editing/myworkshop/aclpub   <i># in csh or tcsh</i>
</pre></blockquote>
</font>

<h3>Set Up Working Directory</h3>

<p>Create a directory somewhere, called <code>proceedings</code>.
You will do all your work in this directory.  Eventually, you'll
send a copy of this directory to the publications chair.</p>

<p><i>Copy</i> the file <code>.../aclpub/make/Makefile_bookchair</code>
to <code>.../proceedings/Makefile</code>.</p>

<p>Depending on how your system is configured, you may soon get a
message asking you to install some less common Perl modules.  If you
would like to check for this message now, type the following, and
follow any instructions that you get.  (If your system is already
okay, you won't get any instructions.)</p>

<blockquote><pre>
make perl-modules
</pre></blockquote>

<h3>Get Data from START</h3>

<p>Assuming you used START to collect camera-ready copy, now you'll
want to get the camera-ready PDF files and metadata provided by your
authors.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use your web browser to go to the START Manager Console.
  </li><li>Choose the option "Final Manuscripts / Monitor Final
  Submissions." Download the submissions (a tarball of
  PDF files) and save it as
<code>.../proceedings/final.tgz</code>.</li> </ul>

<p>The tarball will soon be unpacked into a directory called
<code>final</code>.  (Type <code>make final</code> if you want to make
that happen now.)  If your authors upload any changes to START after
this step, you can either download a new tarball or else make manual
changes in the <code>final</code> directory.</p>

<h3>Check Copyright Signatures</h3>

<p>Your first job is to check that your authors signed their copyright
forms via START.  To create the <code>copyright-signatures</code>
file, type</p>

<blockquote><pre>
make copyright-signatures
</pre></blockquote>

<p>DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE; it is a legal record.  Please review it ASAP
to make sure that appropriate signatures have been provided for all
papers.  Then email it to the publications chair, pointing out any
papers with missing or inappropriate signatures (e.g., "Mickey
Mouse").  You or the publications chair will need to extract <a
href="http://www.aclweb.org/acl2005/pubs/copyright">hardcopy
signatures</a> from those papers' authors in time for their papers to
be included.</p>

<p>If you did not use START to gather the papers, you will need to get
hardcopy forms from your authors.  See our <a
href="http://www.aclweb.org/acl2005/pubs/copyright">copyright
webpage</a> and contact the publications chairs.</p>

<h3>Create Metadata</h3>

<p>Almost all the data about the papers will be maintained in a file
called <code>db</code> (for "database").  To create a first version
from the information in the <code>final</code> directory, type:</p><p>

</p><blockquote><pre>
make db
</pre></blockquote>

<p>You will be editing the <code>db</code> file below, so take a look.
(Here is a somewhat outdated description of its <a
href="http://www.iccs.inf.ed.ac.uk/%7Epkoehn/pubchair-acl05/FORMAT">FORMAT</a>.)
Entries are separated by blank lines.  The first entry for the ACL
2005 main proceedings looks like this:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
P: 7                                                                  <i># submission ID of this paper</i>
T: Coarse-to-fine n-best parsing and MaxEnt discriminative reranking  <i># title</i>
A: Charniak, Eugene                                                   <i># author</i>
A: Johnson, Mark                                                      <i># another author</i>
F: final/7/7_paper.pdf                                                <i># filename of PDF file</i>
L: 8                                                                  <i># length in pages</i>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>If you did not use START to gather the papers and the metadata,
then you have to manually create a directory of the camera-ready PDF
papers, called <code>final</code>.  The PDF filenames do not need to
have the form <code>final/7/7_paper.pdf</code>; for example, you could
use <code>final/charniak-johnson.pdf</code> if you prefer.  You must
also create a <code>db</code> file of metadata in the above format.
Required fields in the <code>db</code> file are P:, T:, A:, F:, and
L:.</p>

<p>If you did use START, but want to add additional papers (invited talk
abstracts, shared task descriptions, ...), then you can add entries
to the <code>db</code> file similarly.</p>

<p><font color="magenta">At present, each <code>db</code> entry including
the last must be <i>followed</i> by a <i>single</i> blank line.</font></p>

<p><font color="magenta">Make sure to get the <code>L:</code> fields
right.  At present, the <code>L:</code> field in a <code>db</code>
entry is only checked against the actual paper length when and if the
entry is created from START metadata.  You will not get a second
warning if you don't fix it, or fix it incorrectly, or create the
<code>db</code> file manually without help from START.</font></p>

<h3>Get Rough Cut</h3>

<p>The following command extracts the first two pages from
each paper and adds margin markings and generates a first
rough cut of the proceedings, <code>book.pdf</code>:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
make draft
</pre></blockquote>

<p>As a convenience, the following command will update
<code>book.pdf</code> <i>and</i> fire up Acrobat:

<blockquote><pre>
make view
</pre></blockquote>

<p>The rough cut is not a full volume yet (e.g., no author index).
But it will reveal a number of potential problems in the automatically
produced <code>db</code> file or the submitted PDF files.</p>

<p>It is possible that your system won't be able to make
<code>book.pdf</code> if your version of <code>pdflatex</code> and
<code>pdfpages</code> is too old.  For example, you may get a message
that it cannot handle some submitted file that is PDF version 1.5.
You could (1) upgrade your software, (2) run on a machine with more
recent software, or (3) ask the author to send you the source
<code>.tex</code> of the submitted file so that you can run it through
your older version of <code>pdflatex</code> yourself, producing a PDF
version 1.4 file.</p>

<h3>Use Rough Cut to Check and Fix the PDF files</h3>

<p>Flip through the rough cut.  Do all the fonts in the papers display
and print correctly?  If not, you will need to ask the author to email
you a corrected version of the PDF file.<p>

<p>The publications chair has probably put up a webpage with
instructions for authors, based on the version at
<code>.../aclpub/doc/authors</code>.  Remind the author to consult
that page.</p>

<p>You can substitute the author's corrected PDF file for the bad
version in the <code>final</code> directory.  If the length, title, or
author list has changed for some reason, you will have to edit or
recreate the <code>db</code> file as well.</p>

<p>Also ask the author for the LaTeX or Word sources, so that you can
produce the corrected PDF file yourself on your machine, if
necessary.</p>

There are three common problems:<p></p>

<ul>
  <li><p>The paper uses the wrong overall font.  Typically, the
author didn't start his or her LaTeX file with</p>
  <blockquote><pre>
\documentclass[11pt]{article}
\usepackage{times}
  </pre></blockquote>
  </li>
  
  <li><p>Asian fonts don't display correctly or cause the PDF viewer
  to report an error.  In this case, the author will need to produce a
  new version of the
  PDF file, with Asian fonts embedded.</p></li>
  
  <li><p>A paper's individual camera-ready PDF file looks okay when
  viewed alone, but when it appears as part of <code>book.pdf</code>,
  there is too much space between the letters.</p>

  <p>We are not sure why this occasionally happens.  But we suspect that
  it is a problem with embedded fonts.  The solution is to recreate
  the paper's PDF file with a more up-to-date version of
  <code>pdflatex</code>.</p>
  </li>

  <li><p>Very occasionally, a bad paper may cause
  acroread to crash.  Try to isolate the bad paper by viewing
  the individually submitted PDF files in the <code>final</code>
  directory, and contact the author.</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Use Rough Cut to Check and Fix the <code>db</code> File</h3>

<p>Now you will check that the metadata in the <code>db</code> are
correct and correctly formatted.</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>Count the papers to make sure you're not missing any (e.g., due to an 
  author's failure to submit camera-ready copy).</p>
  
  </li><li><p>For
  each paper in the rough cut, check that the <code>db</code> information
  (which was supplied by the author when submitting the camera-ready paper)
  really matches the author/title on the actual camera-ready paper.
  If not, fix the <code>db</code> file.</p>
  
  </li><li><p>Each author in the <code>db</code> file should have a separate
  <code>A:</code> entry.  (<i>Note:</i> the <code>R:</code> entry is for debugging
  help only.)  Sometimes the splitting of multiple authors into separate
  authors is faulty and needs to be fixed.</p>

  </li><li><p>Capitalization of authors in the <code>db</code> file
  should be as in BibTeX.  Example:</p>
  
  <blockquote><pre>
Piet Q. van Oostrum, Jr.
  </pre></blockquote>
  
  </li><li>Check the author index at the end of the rough cut to make
  sure that you don't have separate entries for "Doe, Jane" and
  "Doe, J."  That is, if the same author contributed to multiple
  papers, make sure his or her name is written the same way each
  time in the <code>db</code> file.</li>
  
  <li><p>Capitalization of titles in the <code>db</code> file should
  be exactly as in BibTeX, since the <code>db</code> file will
  be used to create public BibTeX files for use by anyone.</p>
  
  <p>BibTeX format is designed to provide enough information for
  BibTeX to use any capitalization style as directed.  The
  proceedings program and table of contents will use the default
  BibTeX conventions almost directly.  However, your <code>db</code>
  file will also be turned into public BibTeX entries that can be
  used by anyone, with any bibliographic style.</p>

  <p>Example:</p>
  
  <blockquote><pre>
The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly: A Mixed-Case Guide to Capitalization in {BibTeX}
    </pre></blockquote>
  
  <p>Specifically:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Always capitalize the first word of the title, and any word
    following a colon.

    </li><li>Except as above, lowercase the following "little words":
    articles, prepositions, coordinating conjunctions, and the
    infinitive marker "to."

    </li><li>Capitalize all content words.  This includes hyphenated words:
    <code>Mixed-Case</code>.
    
    </li><li>If a content word is inherently capitalized and must retain
    capitalization even in a lowercase style (such as ACL's prescribed style
    <code>acl.bst</code>), "protect" it by
    surrounding at least the capital letters with curly braces:
    <code>{E}nglish</code>, <code>{C}homsky</code>,
    <code>{IBM}</code>, <code>{CFG}s</code>, <code>{HMM}s</code> (or
    if you prefer, <code>{English}</code>, <code>{Chomsky}</code>,
    <code>{IBM}</code>, <code>{CFGs}</code>, <code>{HMMs}</code>).

    </li><li>Use LaTeX math mode where appropriate: <code>An $O(n^2)$
    Algorithm for $n$-gram Smoothing</code>.

    </li><li>Use <a href="http://www-h.eng.cam.ac.uk/help/tpl/textprocessing/teTeX/latex/latex2e-html/ltx-401.html">LaTeX
    commands for accents</a>.</li>

  </ul>

  <p><font color="magenta">In future, correcting the bibtex
  capitalization should be attempted first by a
  script.  Protected words could be found by simple corpus analysis
  (e.g., from the submitted papers themselves).</font></p>
</li>

</ul>

<p><font color=magenta>The <code>db</code> file does not currently
permit comments.</font></p>

<h3>Use Rough Cut to Check and Adjust Margins</h3>

<p>If you are satisfied with author and title information after making
appropriate changes in the <code>db</code> file, regenerate the rough
cut, by again typing</p>

<blockquote><pre>
make draft           <i># or "make view"</i>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>The top/bottom margins of the paper are very often wrong.
Unfortunately we have not yet found an automatic method to fix this.
However, we have made it relatively easy for you to fix manually.</p>

<p>The rough-cut version of <code>book.pdf</code> includes a margin
frame and rulers that should make it easy to detect how much each
paper must be shifted to fit. Each paper is also stamped with its
submission ID.</p>

<p>Look especially at page 2 of each paper.  If the text doesn't fit
within the frame, look at the top of the text to see how many
millimeters it should be moved, and add an <code>M:</code> line for
the paper into <code>db</code>. The format of the line is</p>

<blockquote><pre>
M: x-axis-movement y-axis-movement[,more-options]
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Positive values move up and to the right.  Negative values move
down and to the left.  For example, if the top of the text is
<code>14mm</code> below the top of the frame, according to the ruler,
then enter the values <code>0 14</code>.</p>

Common values are:
<blockquote><pre>
M: 0 6
M: 0 -12
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Horizontal correction is rarely needed.  In an exceptional case,
you may need to shrink a page or clip it against a specified bounding
box or something.  You can do this by appending some options that will
be passed to the <A
HREF="http://www.cs.brown.edu/system/software/latex/doc/grfguide.pdf">LaTeX
includegraphics command</A>, which slurps in the page as a graphical
object:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
M: 0 6,scale=0.95
M: 0 10,bb=0 90 612 792,clip
</pre></blockquote>

<FONT color=magenta>You should be able to use multiple <code>M:</code>
lines in order to handle different pages of a paper differently, but
this isn't implemented yet.</FONT>

<p>After entering the margin movement information, you can regenerate
the rough cut (just type <code>make draft</code> again) and check that
everything is at the right place.  Iterate until convergence.</p>

<p><i>Note:</i> If you want the rough cut to include more than 2 pages
of each paper, look in the <code>Makefile</code> to see where the
number <code>2</code> was specified.</p>

<h3>Set Schedule (or at least order of papers)</h3>

<p>In an ACL proceedings, papers should be ordered chronologically by
their time in the program.  This makes the proceedings volume useful
at the conference itself.</p>

<p>But the scripts you are using simply use the order of the papers in the
<code>db</code> file.  Therefore, it is necessary to reorder the
<code>db</code> file chronologically.</p>

<p>We provide another mechanism to help you do this with low risk of
error.  This mechanism also helps you add special <code>H:</code> and
<code>X:</code> lines to the <code>db</code> file.  Those lines help
determine the workshop program that will appear at the front of the
proceedings.</p>

<p>Your first step is to create a draft <code>order</code> file from
the current <code>db</code>.  Type</p>

<blockquote><pre>
make get-order
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Here (roughly) is the start of the draft <code>order</code> file
generated for the ACL 2005 main conference:</p>

<blockquote><pre>

</pre></blockquote>

<p>The <code>order</code> file can contain these kinds of lines:</p>

<ul>

  <li><p><b>Comments:</b> Anything following <code>"#"</code> on a line
  will be ignored by the scripts.  
  

  </p></li><li><p><b>Scheduled papers:</b> A typical line contains a paper
  number followed by a timeslot.   (An optional comment indicates
  the first author and title, for your convenience.)</p>
  </li>
  
  <li><p><b>Unscheduled papers:</b> You may omit a paper's timeslot
  (e.g., in a poster session where the posters run in parallel).  The
  paper ID is enough.  Remember that the order of papers in the
  <code>order</code> file will determine the order in the
  proceedings.</p></li>

  <li><p><b>Days:</b> At the start of each day of the workshop (even if
  there is only one day), add a line beginning
  with <code>*</code> such as:</p>
  
  <blockquote><pre>
* Sunday, June 26, 2005
  </pre></blockquote>
  </li>

  <li><p><b>Session titles:</b> The workshop may be broken up into several
  sessions. For each session title add a line beginning with <code>=</code> such as:</p>

  <blockquote><pre>
= Session M1R: Machine Learning and Statistical Models
  </pre></blockquote>
  </li>

  <li><p><b>Events that do not correspond to papers:</b>
  Breaks, opening remarks, invited talks, panel discussions, awards,
  etc.  For each such event, add a line beginning with <code>+</code>
  such as:</p>

  <blockquote><pre>
+ 9:00--10:00 Invited Talk by Justine Cassell
  </pre></blockquote>

  <p>The timing of breaks may be coordinated across all the workshops
  on a given day.  This allows participants from different workshops
  to mingle over shared snacks.  <b>Please consult the workshops chair
  when deciding when to place your breaks.</b></p>
  
  </li>

</ul>

<p>Once you have edited the <code>order</code> file, you can again try</p>

<blockquote><pre>
make draft           <i># or "make view"</i>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>You are free to edit the <code>db</code> and <code>order</code>
files whenever you want.  The <code>db</code> file still controls the
look of the proceedings.  However, whenever you change the
<code>order</code> file, the <code>db</code> file will be rearranged
to match it, and this in turn will affect the proceedings.  (If the
<code>order</code> file is inconsistent with the <code>db</code> file,
you'll get an error message about extra or missing entries.)</p>

<p><b>Warning:</b> Don't be tempted to directly edit the
<code>H:</code> or <code>X:</code> lines in the <code>db</code> file.
(Such edits will indeed affect your proceedings, but those lines in
<code>db</code> will be completely replaced when and if you change
<code>order</code> again.  <font color=magenta>A safer scheme would make
<code>db</code> by combining human-editable files
<code>metadata</code> and <code>order</code>; a human should not edit
<code>db</code> in place.  This is an easy change and would also
simplify the makefile.</font>)

<h3>Recreate the Proceedings</h3>

<p>Once you're satisfied with the rough cut, have a look at
what the final proceedings will look like:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
make shipout                         <i># create "final" version of book.pdf</i>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>You can switch between <code>make draft</code> and <code>make
shipout</code> as often as you like.  The target file is always called
<code>book.pdf</code>.</p>

<p>For convenience, <code>make book.pdf</code> will update whichever
version of <code>book.pdf</code> you are currently working with,
and <code>make view</code> will both update and display it.</p>

<h3>Edit Workshop-Specific Pages</h3>

<p>A number of <code>*.tex</code> files now have to be manually edited
for workshop-specific information:</p>

<ul>

  <li><p>Edit your workshop title and date in <code>titlepage.tex</code>.
  This will appear on the title page and the workshop cover.  You can type
  <code>make titlepage.pdf</code> to see quickly what just 
  this page will look like.</p></li>
  
  <li><p>Add the logos of your sponsors (if you have any) to the start of
  the proceedings, by editing <code>copyright.tex</code>.  You can type
  <code>make copyright.pdf</code> to see quickly what just
  this page will look like.</p></li>
  
  <li><p>Add your preface by editing <code>preface.tex</code>.  You can type
  <code>make preface.pdf</code> to see quickly what just
  this page will look like.</p></li>
  
  <li><p>Add contributors' names by editing <code>organizers.tex</code>.
  You can type <code>make organizers.pdf</code> to see quickly
  what just this page will look like.</p></li>
  
  <li><p>Fix any ugly page breaks in <code>program.tex</code> and
  <code>toc.tex</code>.  You can type <code>make program.pdf</code> or 
  <code>make toc.pdf</code> to see quickly what just
  these pages will look like.  </p></li>
  
  <li><p>You will have noticed that citation information is stamped at
  the bottom of the first page of every paper.  Edit the
  <code>\citeinfo</code> command in <code>citation-stamp.tex</code> to reflect
  how your workshop should properly be cited. In particular, be
  sure to change the title. Please note that you should
    <b>NOT</b> generate DOIs for ACL conferences, so the code to do so should
    be disabled. The DOIs produced here are incorrect. DOIs are note generated till later, 
    when proceedings are ingested into the Anthology.</p></li>

  <li><p>Edit the PDF metadata in <code>book.tex</code>.  (This will
  appear in the PDF "Document Properties" of the online
  proceedings.)</p>
  <ul>
    <li>edit "pdftitle" field to reflect proceedings title.</li>
    
    <li>optionally edit "pdfauthor" field to include name of your SIG.</li>
  </ul>
  <font color=magenta>This should really come from <code>meta</code>.</font>
  </li>

  <li><p>While not usually necessary, you can edit
  <code>allpapers.tex</code> to fine-tune the treatment
  of individual papers: how they are
  citation-stamped, indexed in the Author Index, graphically included via <A
  HREF="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/pdfpages/pdfpages.pdf"><code>\includepdf</code></A>,
  etc.</p></li>

</ul>

<h3>Final Onscreen Check</h3>

Regenerate the proceedings, and continue to edit the <code>.tex</code> files until
everything looks good:

<blockquote><pre>
make shipout           <i># or "make view"</i>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Make sure that all names are spelled correctly, etc.</p>

<p>Just in case, check the following production issues:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>The first paper should start on an odd page.  That is,
  page 1 should correspond to an odd-numbered page of the full PDF file,
  so that it appears on the right side in the printed volume.  (This
  is supposed to be arranged automatically by <code>\isodd</code>
  macros in <code>book.tex</code>.)

  <li><p>There should be red hyperlinks in the table of contents, program,
  and author index, as well as "bookmarks" at the left of
  the PDF window.  All of these should work when clicked.
  <font color="magenta">In future, it would be nice to have
  hierarchical bookmarks grouped by session.</font></p>

  <li><p>The first page of <i>every</i> paper should have a citation
  stamped below the page number.  This may occasionally be cut off
  (for completely bitmapped papers).  Contact the publications chairs
  for a short-term fix. <font color="magenta">There exists a long-term
  fix for next year.</font></p>

</ul>

<h3>Final Printed Check</h3>

<p>Try printing the PDF file on a black-and-white Postscript printer.
Just because everything works onscreen does not guarantee that it will
work in the printout.</p>

<p>Make sure everything looks fine onscreen and prints fine!  Look
through the online and printed proceedings carefully.  It is the
responsibility of the workshop chair to make sure that everything is
correct.</p>

<h3>Create a Spine Text for the Proceedings</h3>

<p>Edit the file <code>spine.tex</code> to reflect the text that you
want to appear on the binding of the volume.  (<i>Note:</i> If the
volume is too thin to support spine text, this file will be ignored.)</p>

<p>Now type
<blockquote><pre>
make spine
</pre></blockquote>
and check the result with
<blockquote><pre>
gv spine.ps
</pre></blockquote>
</p>

<h3>Make Your CD-ROM Directory</h3>

<p>Now it's time to build your contribution to the CD-ROM, including
HTML pages and BibTeX entries.  For this, you will need to create a
<code>meta</code> file with some metadata about your workshop as a
whole.  Here is an example of the format <font color=magenta>(but this
format will change soon)</font>:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
abbrev		EduApp
type		WORKSHOP
title 		Second Workshop on Building Educational Applications Using NLP
url		http://www.ets.org/research/conferences/nlp.html
booktitle	Proceedings of the Second Workshop on Building Educational Applications Using NLP
month		June
year		2005
location	Ann Arbor, Michigan
chairs		Jill Burstein (Educational Testing Service)
chairs		Claudia Leacock (Personal Knowledge Technologies)
bib_url		http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W/W05/W05-02%02d
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Contact the publications chair for the correct value of the about
the <code>bib_url</code> field for <b>your</b> workshop.  This
determines its permament URL in the ACL Anthology.</p>

<p>To create the cdrom directory, try</p>

<blockquote><pre>
make cdrom
</pre></blockquote>

<p>To create an advertisement webpage for your workshop (basically a
copy of <code>cdrom/program.html</code> that has been stripped of
actual links to the papers), try</p>

<blockquote><pre>
make cdrom
</pre></blockquote>

<h3>Wrap Everything Up and Send It Off!</h3>

<p>You should still be in the <code>"proceedings"</code> directory that you created
at the beginning.  Type the following:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
make all
</pre></blockquote>

<p>This will check that everything is up to date, and package up your
<code>proceedings</code> directory as a tarball file
<code><code>proceedings.tgz</code> in the parent directory.</p>

<p>Send <code>../proceedings.tgz</code> by the deadline to the
publications chair.  Use an email attachment if necessary, but it
would be nicer just to email an <code>http:</code> or
<code>ftp:</code> URL where the <code>proceedings.tgz</code> file can
be downloaded.  <FONT color="magenta">One day, the makefile should
know how to upload to a standard ftp site or something ...</FONT></p>

<p>While we want the whole tarball so that we can rerun the scripts in
case of problems, it is especially essential that we receive:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>book.pdf</code>, the proceedings</li>
  <li><code>db</code>, the reordered database file</li>
  <li><code>final.tgz</code>, the PDF files of the papers and metadata</li>
  <li><code>citation-stamp.tex</code>, the template for the citation text stamped on each paper
  <li><code>spine.ps</code>, the spine</li>
  <li><code>copyright-signatures</code>, the file with the copyright signatures</li>
  <li>anything that should go on the CD in addition to the papers</li>
</ul>

<p>Congratulations and <b>thank you</b>!</p>
